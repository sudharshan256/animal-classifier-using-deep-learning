This project is an animal classifier which groups animals according to their types like cow, cat, dog, etc..... This project is created in context of Deep Learning using modules like Tensorflow, Keras, Pillow.... Paste this code in your compiler with some training datasets in a folder and run the code for the training the datasets and close the training window. Create a new window and paste the predictor code where you will be also pasting the path of the your testing data and then run it. The compiler then classifies that respective animal....
